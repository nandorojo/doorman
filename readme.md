## 🧐 What is Doorman?

Doorman lets React Native developers add phone authentication to their apps with ease. It works perfectly with **Firebase Auth and Expo**.

**We handle the backend and provide UI components** 😇 for Firebase phone auth. That means you can spend less time worrying about the auth flow, and more time building your actual features.

Our mission is to help you create **incredible apps** that **your users will love**. And that all starts with the first impression they make with your app – your auth flow.

## 😎 With Doorman, you can...

- 👟Build a phone authentication flow in a few lines of code.

- 💅Fully customize the design to fit your app.

* 👩‍💻Avoid maintaining a complex server.

* 🔥Keep using Firebase Auth with Expo.

* 🕺Create a native auth experience, without web views or popups.
