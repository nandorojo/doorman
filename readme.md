# Welcome to Doorman 👋

Firebase phone auth for Expo/React Native apps.

---

Doorman lets React Native developers add phone authentication to their apps with ease. It works perfectly with **Firebase Auth and Expo**.

**We handle the backend and provide UI components** 😇 for Firebase phone auth. That means you can spend less time worrying about the auth flow, and more time building your actual features.

Our mission is to help you create **incredible apps** that **your users will love**. And that all starts with the first impression they make with your app – your auth flow.
