 * `useAuthFlowState`
 *
 * The auth flow state exposes the `ready` and `phoneNumber` values created by the auth flow.
 *
 * The `phoneNumber` is just whatever the user has typed in the form. It is then accessed by the code verification screen to let people know what number their text was sent to.
 *
 * Meanwhile, the `ready` prop is used only to manage the transition between the `<AuthFlow.PhoneScreen />` and `<AuthFlow.CodeScreen />`.
 *
 * If `ready` is true, it shows the code screen. Otherwise, it shows the phone screen.
