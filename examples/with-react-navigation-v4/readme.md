# 🚪 👾 Doorman + React Navigation v4 example

By default, Doorman implements its own "stack". However, if you're using React Navigation, this example shows you how to take more ownership of your auth flow by making your own stack instead.

## 🏄🏾‍♂️ To try out this example:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nandorojo/doorman
cd examples/with-react-navigation-v4
yarn
expo start --ios # or expo start --android
```

This example uses our test account's `publicProjectId` (found on the Doorman dashboard), and `firebaseConfig`, found on Firebase's console.
